Meeting Minutes:

1. Topics Discussed:
- Usage of the view function from one table to another.

2. Items Agreed Upon:
- Using the customer table, we should see all the views of the other remaining tables.

4. Next Things to Do
- Learn access controls and the reverse of the for loop function on table views (many to one).

5. Conclusion
- Had a productive week because we learned how to use the view function on another level.

- Was shock to know that all, if not, majority of the PC's in the room were reformatted, thus we aren't able to update our system. We will do the updates at home.
