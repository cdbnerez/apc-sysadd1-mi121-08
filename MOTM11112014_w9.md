Meeting Minutes:

1. Topics Discussed:

- None, Carlos fixed the errors in the system (Order, Orderlist, Payment Method tables)

- Since 3rd iteration is within this week, we need to update the hosted system and its database

2. Items Agreed Upon:

- Finish the mobile css to be ready for the 3rd iteration presentation

- Make sure that the system's flow is atleast 80% polish

- Make sure that the ID's can be transferred from one table to another

3. Items to be clarified

- (Research/Study more) Mobile theme for the css

- To lessen errors on the ID's (CDB Exception and CE Exception errors), ID's must be properly defined inside the model, controller and view files

5. Conclusion

- We've managed to improve the system's flow and mobile css; however, we need to catch up with the requirements set by the client and professor. Nevertheless, we are expecting that by the end of 3rd iteration, we have completed atleast 85% of the entire project. The remaining 15% is for the security features and system polishing.
