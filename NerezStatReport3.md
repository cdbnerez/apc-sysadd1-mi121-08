Carlos Daniel B. Nerez 3rd Weekly Status Report

A. Tasks accomplished

- Learned how to connect tables that enabled us to view their "view.php" file using a table directly and indirectly related to it.

- Combined Four tables: Customer, Delivery, Order and Payment Method Using customer table, you can now see the delivery, order and payment method information of that particular customer.

B. Problems encountered

- Before learning how to achieve the task accomplished listed above, I had a hard time identifying the problem. I thought there was a problem with the tables relationships or the database itself.

- Our GitClone / Clone of our repository in our computer unit was deleted. We think the pc's where reformatted, thus causing all files (Clone, git and tortoise git) to be deleted.

C. Possible solutions

- Collaborated with other groups to fix the problem; Apply nested loop to the view.php in order to access the views of other directly related and indirectly related tables.

- Re - install git, tortoise git and clone the project to the pc to continue with the project.

D. Next steps to accomplish

- Continue to develop and improve the project.
